## Dev Git Guideline:

1. `git pull` to pull the latest changes before adding your changes.

2. `git checkout -b feature/issue-#-username-quick-description` checkout your changes to a new branch. 

3. `git add .` to add all the files you made changes to or files you've added/removed. 

4. `git commit` This will open an editor, ignore the commented jargon and add a sentence or bullet points detailing what was done.

    Example:
        Fixed issue where the react page would not load when clicking on it's corresponding button as it was not linked to the page. 
        
    Or:
        - Added a new section in the job submission page for more granular control about the RNA moleclue.
        - Added a new button in the job submission page for the user to submit. No functionality yet for the button.

4. `git push`
